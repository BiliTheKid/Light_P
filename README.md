App for Light pollution reporting.
Light pollution, also known as photopollution, is the presence of anthropogenic light in the night environment. 
It is exacerbated by excessive, misdirected or obtrusive uses of light, but even carefully used light fundamentally alters natural conditions. 
As a major side-effect of urbanization, it is blamed for compromising health, disrupting ecosystems and spoiling aesthetic environments.

 we used android studio to develop the app & firebase for the data base.

the project sampling points(using sensors location and light) and send it to the database(firebase).
the DB check location longitude and latitude and allocated it and map and report the pollution.
